msgstr ""

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:23
msgid "4b)\nSociocultural analysis connects factors of the social context, which together with an understanding of the needs, norms, and values that define our community, allows us to design appropriate solutions."

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:28
msgid "4c)\nAnalysis of our reality as a community will help us make wise collective decisions and create an identity that represents us.\nDecisions about the characteristics of our free/libre community network will be made based on the type of relations that exist in our community.\nThis is why it's so important to do this analysis: to foresee the limitations and necessities that may arise in our network project with respect to the people who will use it and the ways they'll use it."

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:42
msgid "5b)\nWhat causes motivate the construction of a free/libre community network?\nHow many inhabitants does the community have?\nWho would use the network and for what?\nYou can also do an informal census that records age groups, gender, or other relevant characteristics.\nIt's important to consider if any particular condition such as a seasonal work activity makes the population grow or shrink abruptly according to the time of year.\nWhat activities predominate in the area and how could the network affect them?\nIs there a recurring threat?\nWhat knowledge of and access to Internet devices do the network members have?\nBased on experiences of previous projects, what level of social committment exists in the community?"

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:45
msgid "6a)\nThe ideal is to create a networks that's both digital and made of people with strong relationships to the community. To achieve this objective, the inclusion and participation of community entities and spaces is very important, such as schools, clubs, government entities, media, housing, cultural centers, plazas, and public transit stops."
msgstr ""

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:48
msgid "6b)\nTo give a few examples: There are networks in touristic localities that have to limit access during vacation times in order to maintain the good functioning of the network. Other localities have made a \"godparents\" arrangement to assist families that for various cultural reasons find it impossible to manage their network node themselves. There are also localities that have decided to leave their network accessible and open in public areas given the complete absence of coverage of other communication services."

msgid "7a)\nOrganize action"
msgstr ""

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:54
msgid "7b)\nDesigning an organization of the work, communication, learning, and gatherings that involves and inspires all to participate is a big challenge and is vital for the functioning of a free/libre community network."
msgstr ""

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:59
msgid "7c)\nCommonly, when people gather to work collectively, the diversity among people highlights unique attitudes and personal knowledge that are complementary to each other.\nDefining roles, collective work areas, and internal communication practices enables self-management to keep the project going long-term.\nChoosing a name for the nework and designing a logo or representative image supports the creation of collective identity. Making a web site can do the same."
msgstr ""

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:65
msgid "8a)\nDefining short- and long-term goals helps speed up and clearly orient group work processes.  In addition, it encourages members to take on proactive roles in the resolution of problems and collective participation in decision making.\nIt's to be expected that network members will show different degrees of committment. Some will dedicate more effort than others or develop different abilities.\nDue to this, it's healthy to define a minimum committment that all members should meet in order to participate in the project.\nThe elaboration and sharing of the network's characteristics -- such as conversation about what the network is, how it's members should act, and their specific roles -- gives clarity to the project."
msgstr ""

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:68
msgid "9a)\nPeriodic in-person meetings are a very important tool for creating community spaces, and for making decisions, sharing knowledge, planning, and resolving problems. Meeting also offers a space where collective and community identity is built and invites other people to join the network."
msgstr ""

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:73
msgid "9b)\nTo give some examples: there are networks that have mi-monthly meetings with an agenda created ahead of time with topics to discuss and with written minutes made during the meeting. Is this way a summary can be shared with the people unable to attend and can also be put in an archive of the network.\nIn other cases, talks and workshops are organized for the people who wish to be part of the network. On occasion, the meetings are mandatory for new members.\nIn some networks, frequent conversation among network members happens via group communication tools, exchanging opinions, specific problems, or information."

msgid "10a)\nThink about financing"
msgstr ""

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:79
msgid "10b)\nDoing an economic analysis will allow us to estimate and plan the monetary investment necessary to implement the project and sustain it over time."
msgstr ""

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:83
msgid "10c)\nKnowing how much money is needed for our network to function will allow us to evaluate diverse mechanisms of self-management and financing for the different phases of purchasing, construction, installtion, repair, growth, and upgrading of the network.\nSo, on one hand, it's necessary to consider how much money and other resource we need, and, on the other hand, how we will obtain them."
msgstr ""

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:86
msgid "11a)\nThere are diverse ways to get resources, such as:"
msgstr ""

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:96
msgid "11b)\nDonation and non-monetary exchange, such as barter\nDirect financing such as subscriptions, monthly network membership dues, or donations\nShared capital such as mutual aid funds\nParticipation of foundations or community associations\nPublic financing such as subsidies or partnerships with government entities\nDonations or contributions made by businesses\nEvents organized to raise funds, among others...\nA combination of options makes the project more sustainable."
msgstr ""

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:100
msgid "12a)\nDeployment and initial construction of the network tends to be the most complex and demanding moment, since in addition to the nodes, it's necessary to acquire the tools and necessary materials and also keep in mind some extra money to buy replacements.\nBulk or wholesale purchases by groups notably reduces costs and creates availability of materials, but at the same time requires a larger monetary investment."
msgstr ""

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:104
msgid "12b) \nTo give some examples of how we can think about financing, we can loos at community networks where each person who joins takes on the costs of their node individually. In other networks, the node is only paid for when installed, and repairs and upgrades are paid from a collective fund created by monthly contributions from each member.\nThere's also a network in which the first nodes were financed by and NGO, the Internet link was handled by a local ISP, and the network members carried out the installation."

msgid "13b)\nKeeping a reliable record maintained by the network members who want to take on the role of administrators is vital for the organized and ordered functioning of the network."
msgstr ""

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:120
msgid "13c)\nThis allows us to have collective knowledge of the movement of money, materials, tools, and other resources. Some of the most common records are:\nPurchases made and planned\nInventory of materials and tools, with the places where they're kept\nList of prices of available materials, thinking about their replacement\nDetails of money and other value put into the network\nArchive of agreements and documents important to the project\nCalendar of periodic responsibilities, payments, reports, etc...\nContact directory"

msgid "14a)\nPlan the deployment/installation"
msgstr ""

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:126
msgid "14b)\nDoing a technical analysis before the network deployment allows for efficient organizing of the tasks and resources. Having everything necessary at the moment of carrying out a task helps that the group be agile and tidy and that the task gets finished on time and in good shape. This includes both the material and the knowledge necessary for carrying out the task."
msgstr ""

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:130
msgid "14c)\nWhile there are numerous technolgical alternatives for the construction of a community network, this model proposes the LibreRouter as the primary device. The LibreRouter makes deployment of libre community networks easier since is was designed with this objective.\nThe vast majority of nodes in the network will not present great challenges. However, there will be cases that require more creative and more technical attention. It can even be necessary to collaborate with people beyond the network who have specific knowledge to solve particular problems."
msgstr ""

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:133
msgid "15a)\nThe members with a more technical profile could debate, for example, the following topics:"

msgid "15b)\nWhat will be the structure of the network, both in the beginning and as it grows\nHow to stregthen the network by building redundant links and thus reaching the same point via more than one path\nIdentify nodes with more data traffic or overburdened and guarantee their proper functioning\nCreate multiple paths to relevant points in the network, such as the connection with the Internet or with local servers\nIdentify the need for specific or more powerful devices\nSolve issues of unconventional electrical energy\nHelp with methods for sharing services and content on the network"
msgstr ""

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:144
msgid "15c)\nIn some cases, it can be necessary to mount nodes with different antennas than the rest of the nodes, and it can also be convenient to deploy sections of the network with cable instead of wireless links. Some situations will demand unconventional electrical sources or backup power supplies with batteries. Each network will present its technical peculiarities that should be solved with patience, creativity, and collaboration both within and beyond the network."
