msgid "4c)\nAnalysis of our reality as a community will help us make wise collective decisions and create an identity that represents us.\nDecisions about the characteristics of our free/libre community network will be made based on the type of relations that exist in our community.\nThis is why it's so important to do this analysis: to foresee the limitations and necessities that may arise in our network project with respect to the people who will use it and the ways they'll use it."

msgstr "5a)\n要指引您自己在此分析，您可以考慮："

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:42
msgid "5b)\nWhat causes motivate the construction of a free/libre community network?\nHow many inhabitants does the community have?\nWho would use the network and for what?\nYou can also do an informal census that records age groups, gender, or other relevant characteristics.\nIt's important to consider if any particular condition such as a seasonal work activity makes the population grow or shrink abruptly according to the time of year.\nWhat activities predominate in the area and how could the network affect them?\nIs there a recurring threat?\nWhat knowledge of and access to Internet devices do the network members have?\nBased on experiences of previous projects, what level of social committment exists in the community?"
msgstr "5b)\n是什麼動機促成建立免費/自由社區網絡？\n社區有多少居民？\n誰會使用網路並出於何種目的？\n您也可以進行非正式的人口普查，並記錄下年齡層、性別，或是其它相關特徵。\n重要的是要考慮是否有特定條件，例如季節性的工作事項讓人口在一年內時間裡突然增加或減少。\n哪幾種活動在區域裡佔有多數，以及網路會如何影響它們？\n是否有反覆出現的脅迫情況？\n網路成員具備怎樣的網路設施知識以及取用權限？\n基於過往專案經歷，社區存在何種程度的社會責任？"

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:45
msgid "6a)\nThe ideal is to create a networks that's both digital and made of people with strong relationships to the community. To achieve this objective, the inclusion and participation of community entities and spaces is very important, such as schools, clubs, government entities, media, housing, cultural centers, plazas, and public transit stops."
msgstr "6a)\n理想是建立一個數位化以及讓人們能與社區有密切關聯的網絡。要實現這個目的，社區實體與空間的包容和參與是非常重要的，例如學校、俱樂部、政府實體、媒體、住宅、文化中心、廣場、和公共轉運站。"

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:48
msgid "6b)\nTo give a few examples: There are networks in touristic localities that have to limit access during vacation times in order to maintain the good functioning of the network. Other localities have made a \"godparents\" arrangement to assist families that for various cultural reasons find it impossible to manage their network node themselves. There are also localities that have decided to leave their network accessible and open in public areas given the complete absence of coverage of other communication services."

msgstr "7b)\n設計一個關於運作、交流、學習、和涉及與激勵所有參與者之聚會的組織是一項巨大挑戰，且對於免費/自由社群網絡的作用是至關重要的。"

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:59
msgid "7c)\nCommonly, when people gather to work collectively, the diversity among people highlights unique attitudes and personal knowledge that are complementary to each other.\nDefining roles, collective work areas, and internal communication practices enables self-management to keep the project going long-term.\nChoosing a name for the nework and designing a logo or representative image supports the creation of collective identity. Making a web site can do the same."

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:65
msgid "8a)\nDefining short- and long-term goals helps speed up and clearly orient group work processes.  In addition, it encourages members to take on proactive roles in the resolution of problems and collective participation in decision making.\nIt's to be expected that network members will show different degrees of committment. Some will dedicate more effort than others or develop different abilities.\nDue to this, it's healthy to define a minimum committment that all members should meet in order to participate in the project.\nThe elaboration and sharing of the network's characteristics -- such as conversation about what the network is, how it's members should act, and their specific roles -- gives clarity to the project."

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:68
msgid "9a)\nPeriodic in-person meetings are a very important tool for creating community spaces, and for making decisions, sharing knowledge, planning, and resolving problems. Meeting also offers a space where collective and community identity is built and invites other people to join the network."
msgstr "9a)\n定期的參與集會是創建出社區空間、做出決策、分享知識、計劃、以及解決問題的重要工具。集會另提供了建置集體與社區認同的空間，並邀請其他人一同加入網絡。"

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:73
msgid "9b)\nTo give some examples: there are networks that have mi-monthly meetings with an agenda created ahead of time with topics to discuss and with written minutes made during the meeting. Is this way a summary can be shared with the people unable to attend and can also be put in an archive of the network.\nIn other cases, talks and workshops are organized for the people who wish to be part of the network. On occasion, the meetings are mandatory for new members.\nIn some networks, frequent conversation among network members happens via group communication tools, exchanging opinions, specific problems, or information."

msgid "10c)\nKnowing how much money is needed for our network to function will allow us to evaluate diverse mechanisms of self-management and financing for the different phases of purchasing, construction, installtion, repair, growth, and upgrading of the network.\nSo, on one hand, it's necessary to consider how much money and other resource we need, and, on the other hand, how we will obtain them."
msgstr "10c)\n了解我們所要運作的網路需要花費多少金額，能讓我們來評估自我管理的各項機制，以及用於網路的採購、建設、安裝、修復、發展、以及升級等不同階段的資金。因此一方面，有需要考慮我們需要多少的金錢與其它資源；另一方面，我們又是要如何來取得到這些。"

msgid "12a)\nDeployment and initial construction of the network tends to be the most complex and demanding moment, since in addition to the nodes, it's necessary to acquire the tools and necessary materials and also keep in mind some extra money to buy replacements.\nBulk or wholesale purchases by groups notably reduces costs and creates availability of materials, but at the same time requires a larger monetary investment."
msgstr ""

#: 02-en-Planning.txt:104
msgid "12b) \nTo give some examples of how we can think about financing, we can loos at community networks where each person who joins takes on the costs of their node individually. In other networks, the node is only paid for when installed, and repairs and upgrades are paid from a collective fund created by monthly contributions from each member.\nThere's also a network in which the first nodes were financed by and NGO, the Internet link was handled by a local ISP, and the network members carried out the installation."

Some of the most common records are:\nPurchases made and planned\nInventory of materials and tools, with the places where they're kept\nList of prices of available materials, thinking about their replacement\nDetails of money and other value put into the network\nArchive of agreements and documents important to the project\nCalendar of periodic responsibilities, payments, reports, etc...\nContact directory"

This includes both the material and the knowledge necessary for carrying out the task."
msgstr "14b)\n在網路部屬之前，進行技術分析能有效組織任務與資源。擁有在執行任務時所需的任何事物，有助於群組機敏且有序，並且能讓任務在良好狀態下按時完成。這包含著用於執行任務時所需的材料與知識。"

msgid "14c)\nWhile there are numerous technolgical alternatives for the construction of a community network, this model proposes the LibreRouter as the primary device. The LibreRouter makes deployment of libre community networks easier since is was designed with this objective.\nThe vast majority of nodes in the network will not present great challenges. However, there will be cases that require more creative and more technical attention. It can even be necessary to collaborate with people beyond the network who have specific knowledge to solve particular problems."

msgid "15c)\nIn some cases, it can be necessary to mount nodes with different antennas than the rest of the nodes, and it can also be convenient to deploy sections of the network with cable instead of wireless links. Some situations will demand unconventional electrical sources or backup power supplies with batteries. Each network will present its technical peculiarities that should be solved with patience, creativity, and collaboration both within and beyond the network."
